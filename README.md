## My process

I decided to use only HTML and css. No frames to test my speed. Since the project is simple, I avoid to use classes in my css. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow



### What I learned

This was a great way for me to practice timing myself and coding faster, with better code. This project took about 1.5 hours to complete. Improvement is happening!
